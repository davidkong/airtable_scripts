# airtable_scripts
Some scripts to increase the functionality of Airtable

This script, when pasted in the Script Block of an Airtable database, will rename the items with a numerical prefix according to their order in the current view.

This allows you to sort the rows manually but also preserve that order so that it can be used in other views, lookups etc.
